# Subtitlr

Subtitlr is an open source OS X app used to find and download subtitles easily. Video files are dropped into the app which then finds their hashcodes using OpenSubtitles.org algorithm and maches them against their database. Matched subtitles are downloaded in the same directory where the video files are located.
